# Operators & Conditional Statements

## What You Will Learn in This Lesson

You have already learned how to write Python programs using variables, arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and basic **input/output**. Your programs could calculate marks, split bills, and show results — but they always followed the same straight path from top to bottom.

In this lesson, you will learn how to make your programs **think and choose**. You will use **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to run different code depending on whether a condition is **True** or **False**. You will also practise **logical thinking** — breaking real problems into small, testable steps before writing code.

By the end, you will be able to write programs that check exam results, apply discounts, validate user input, and handle multiple possible outcomes — just like real apps do every day.

## Why Do Programs Need to Make Decisions?

- **Official Definition:** **Program flow control** is the ability of a program to change the order of execution based on conditions, rather than running every line in a fixed sequence.
- **In Simple Words:** Decision-making in code means the program picks what to do next — like choosing a different road at a fork.
- **Real-Life Example:** At a railway station, if your ticket is for Platform 3, you walk left; otherwise, you walk right. The platform number is the **condition**, and your direction is the **action**.

- **UPI apps** check your balance before allowing a payment — if balance is low, they show an error.
- **Exam result portals** display "Pass" or "Fail" based on marks.
- **ATMs** ask for your PIN — wrong PIN blocks withdrawal; correct PIN opens the menu.

Without conditionals, every program would be like a fixed recipe that never changes. Conditionals make programs **smart and responsive**.

## Quick Recap: Conditions and Boolean Values

A **condition** is any expression that Python evaluates as either **True** or **False**.

- **Official Definition:** A **boolean** is a data type that can hold only two values: `True` or `False`.
- **In Simple Words:** A boolean is a yes-or-no answer stored in code.
- **Real-Life Example:** When a shopkeeper asks "Do you have a membership card?" your answer is either yes or no.

### Comparison Operators — A Quick Reminder

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `==` | Equal to | `50 == 50` | `True` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `50 != 40` | `True` |
| `>` | Greater than | `85 > 40` | `True` |
| `<` | Less than | `30 < 40` | `True` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `40 >= 40` | `True` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `35 <= 40` | `True` |

### Logical Operators — A Quick Reminder

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `and` | Both must be True | `True and False` | `False` |
| `or` | At least one must be True | `True or False` | `True` |
| `not` | Reverses True to False | `not True` | `False` |

![Boolean values and comparison operators — all six comparison operators with examples, logical and/or/not truth table, and the common = vs == mistake](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitp-sdai-2606/module1/session02/session02-02-boolean-conditions.png?v=20260614)

```python
# Check scholarship eligibility: marks >= 80 AND attendance >= 75
marks = 88          # Marks out of 100
attendance = 82     # Attendance percentage
qualifies = (marks >= 80) and (attendance >= 75)  # Both conditions must be true
print(qualifies)  # Prints True because both conditions are met
```

**How the code works:**

- `and` requires **both** sides to be `True`.
- **Common mistake:** Using `=` instead of `==`. `marks = 80` assigns; `marks == 80` compares.

Now that you can build conditions, the next step is telling Python **what to do** when a condition is true — that is where `if` comes in.

---

## The `if` Statement — Running Code Only When a Condition Is True

- **Official Definition:** An **`if` statement** executes a block of code only when its condition evaluates to `True`.
- **In Simple Words:** `if` means "only do this when the check passes."
- **Real-Life Example:** "If it is raining, take an umbrella." The action happens only when the condition is true.

### Basic Syntax and Rules

```python
if condition:  # Condition followed by a colon
    # Indented code runs only when condition is True (usually 4 spaces)
```

- Start with `if`, then the **condition**, then a **colon `:`**.
- Indented lines belong to the `if` block. If the condition is `False`, Python **skips** that block.
- Lines **not indented** after the block always run.

![if statement diagram — full voting eligibility code, syntax rules, True vs False paths, and step-by-step flow from input to output](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitp-sdai-2606/module1/session02/session02-03-if-statement-flow.png?v=20260614)

### `if` with User Input

```python
# Ask the user for their age and check voting eligibility (age 18+ in India)
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Convert input text to a whole number
if age >= 18:  # Condition: is age 18 or above?
    print("You are eligible to vote.")  # Runs only when condition is True
```

**How the code works:**

- `int()` converts input text to a number before comparing.
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting `int()` — comparing `"20" >= 18` causes a `TypeError`.
- **Indentation** defines which lines belong to the `if` block. Wrong indentation causes an `IndentationError`.

### Quick Activity: Temperature Check

Write a program that asks for today's temperature in Celsius. If it is above 35, print a hot-weather warning.

```python
# Check if temperature is above 35 degrees Celsius
temperature = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))  # Allow decimal values
if temperature > 35:  # Condition: hotter than 35
    print("It is very hot today — stay hydrated!")  # Warning message
```

**How the code works:**

- `float()` handles decimal temperatures like 36.5.
- Run with 38 and 30 to see when the message appears vs when it does not.

An `if` handles "when true, do something." When the condition is false, `else` provides the alternative.

---

## The `else` Statement — What to Do When the Condition Is False

- **Official Definition:** An **`else` statement** runs when the `if` condition is `False`.
- **In Simple Words:** `else` means "otherwise, do this instead."
- **Real-Life Example:** "If the milk is boiled, turn off the gas; **else**, keep heating."

![if/else diagram — pass/fail decision tree with complete code for even/odd checker and modulus remainder explanation](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitp-sdai-2606/module1/session02/session02-04-if-else-branches.png?v=20260614)

### Pass or Fail Program

```python
# Get marks and check pass or fail (passing marks = 40)
marks = int(input("Enter your marks out of 100: "))  # Convert input to integer
if marks >= 40:  # Marks 40 or above means pass
    print("Result: PASS")  # Student passed
else:  # Marks below 40
    print("Result: FAIL")  # Student failed
```

**How the code works:**

- Exactly **one** block runs — never both, never neither.
- `else` automatically covers everything the `if` did not catch.

### Even or Odd Number Checker

```python
# Check if a number is even using the modulus operator
number = int(input("Enter a whole number: "))  # Get number from user
if number % 2 == 0:  # Remainder 0 means even
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")  # Divisible by 2
else:  # Remainder is 1
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")  # Not divisible by 2
```

**How the code works:**

- `number % 2` gives the remainder when divided by 2 — very useful for divisibility checks.

Many problems have **more than two** outcomes — like exam grades. That is what `elif` is for.

---

## The `elif` Statement — Handling Multiple Conditions

- **Official Definition:** **`elif`** checks additional conditions when previous ones are `False`.
- **In Simple Words:** `elif` means "if the first check failed, try this next one."
- **Real-Life Example:** At a restaurant — thali, **elif** dosa, **else** default combo. Checked in order.

### Basic Syntax and Rules

```python
if condition_1:      # Checked first
    # Runs when condition_1 is True
elif condition_2:    # Checked only if condition_1 was False
    # Runs when condition_2 is True
else:                # Runs when all above are False
    # Default case
```

- Python checks **top to bottom** and stops at the **first** `True` condition.
- Only **one** block in the chain runs. Put the **strictest** condition first.

### Grade Calculator

```python
# Assign grade based on marks range
marks = int(input("Enter marks out of 100: "))  # Get marks as integer
if marks >= 90:  # 90 to 100
    print("Grade: A — Outstanding!")  # Top grade
elif marks >= 75:  # 75 to 89
    print("Grade: B — Very Good!")  # Second grade
elif marks >= 60:  # 60 to 74
    print("Grade: C — Good")  # Third grade
elif marks >= 40:  # 40 to 59
    print("Grade: D — Needs improvement")  # Pass grade
else:  # Below 40
    print("Grade: F — Failed")  # Fail grade
```

**How the code works:**

- If marks is 95, only "Grade: A" prints — remaining conditions are skipped.
- **Common mistake:** Putting `marks >= 40` before `marks >= 90` — almost everyone would get Grade D.

### Quick Activity: Electricity Bill Slab

An electricity board charges ₹5/unit for the first 100 units, ₹7/unit for 101–200, and ₹10/unit beyond 200. Write a program that asks for units consumed and prints the billing slab.

```python
# Determine billing slab based on units consumed
units = int(input("Enter total units consumed: "))  # Total electricity units
if units <= 100:  # First slab: up to 100 units
    print("Slab: First 100 units — rate ₹5 per unit")  # Lowest rate
elif units <= 200:  # Second slab: 101 to 200 units
    print("Slab: 101 to 200 units — rate ₹7 per unit")  # Middle rate
else:  # Above 200 units
    print("Slab: Above 200 units — rate ₹10 per unit")  # Highest rate
```

**How the code works:**

- `elif units <= 200` only runs when the first condition was `False`, so it means 101 to 200.
- Categorising input into ranges is one of the most common uses of `elif`.

### Train Ticket Category by Age

```python
# Determine train ticket type based on passenger age
age = int(input("Enter passenger age: "))  # Age in years
if age < 5:  # Children under 5
    print("Ticket: FREE (child under 5)")  # No ticket needed
elif age <= 12:  # Children aged 5 to 12
    print("Ticket: CHILD (half fare)")  # Discounted child ticket
elif age < 60:  # Adults aged 13 to 59
    print("Ticket: ADULT (full fare)")  # Standard fare
else:  # Senior citizens 60+
    print("Ticket: SENIOR CITIZEN (senior discount)")  # Senior discount
```

**How the code works:**

- Each `elif` handles one age range. A 10-year-old matches `age <= 12`; a 65-year-old reaches `else`.

---

## Combining Logical Operators Inside Conditions

Use `and`, `or`, and `not` directly inside `if` conditions when one check is not enough.

### Scholarship and Discount Examples

```python
# Example 1: and — both conditions must be True
marks = int(input("Enter marks: "))                # Get marks
attendance = int(input("Enter attendance %: "))    # Get attendance
if (marks >= 80) and (attendance >= 75):           # Both must pass
    print("You are eligible for the scholarship!") # Granted
else:  # Scholarship criteria not met
    print("Sorry, you do not meet the scholarship criteria.")  # Not eligible

# Example 2: or — at least one condition must be True
amount = float(input("Enter purchase amount in rupees: "))       # Bill amount
has_membership = input("Do you have a membership card? (yes/no): ")  # Membership
if (amount > 1000) or (has_membership == "yes"):  # Either condition gives discount
    discount = amount * 0.20           # 20% discount
    final_amount = amount - discount     # Price after discount
    print(f"Discount applied! You pay ₹{final_amount}")  # Discounted price
else:  # No discount applies
    print(f"No discount. You pay ₹{amount}")  # Full price
```

**How the code works:**

- `and` — both sides must be `True`. `or` — at least one side must be `True`.
- `not` flips `True` to `False` — useful when you want the opposite check.

### Using `not` — Reversing a Condition

```python
# Allow login only when account is NOT locked
is_locked = False  # False means account is active
if not is_locked:  # not False becomes True — account is open
    print("Login successful! Welcome back.")  # User can log in
else:  # Account is locked
    print("Account is locked. Contact support.")  # Block access
```

**How the code works:**

- `not is_locked` is `True` when `is_locked` is `False`.
- Parentheses around comparisons in complex conditions make code easier to read.

---

## Nested Conditionals — Decisions Inside Decisions

- **Official Definition:** A **nested conditional** is an `if` block placed inside another `if` block.
- **In Simple Words:** Check a second condition only after the first one passes.
- **Real-Life Example:** "If you have a ticket, enter the stadium. If you also have a VIP pass, go to the premium stand."

### Login with Username and Password

```python
# Correct credentials (in real apps, stored securely in a database)
correct_username = "student01"  # Expected username
correct_password = "pass1234"   # Expected password

# Get login details and validate
username = input("Enter username: ")  # User types username
password = input("Enter password: ")  # User types password
if username == correct_username:    # Outer check: username
    if password == correct_password:  # Inner check: password
        print("Login successful! Welcome.")  # Both correct
    else:  # Password did not match
        print("Wrong password. Please try again.")  # Username OK, password wrong
else:  # Username did not match
    print("Username not found.")  # Username wrong
```

**How the code works:**

- The inner `if` only runs when the username is correct — different error messages for each failure.
- If nesting goes deeper than 2–3 levels, rewrite with `and`/`or` or `elif` for readability.

## Common Mistakes with Conditionals

| Mistake | Wrong Code | Correct Code | Why It Fails |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Using `=` instead of `==` | `if marks = 50:` | `if marks == 50:` | `=` assigns; `==` compares |
| Forgetting the colon | `if marks >= 40` | `if marks >= 40:` | Python expects `:` |
| Wrong indentation | No indent after `if` | Indent with 4 spaces | Python cannot find the block |
| String vs number | `age == 18` when age is `"18"` | `int(age) == 18` | Different types |
| Wrong `elif` order | `>= 40` before `>= 90` | Put `>= 90` first | Higher threshold first |
| Empty `if` block | Nothing below `if` | Use `pass` or real code | Python disallows empty blocks |

![Common conditional mistakes — all six errors with wrong code, correct code, reason, and debugging tips for boundary values](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitp-sdai-2606/module1/session02/session02-09-common-mistakes.png?v=20260614)

Use **`pass`** as a placeholder in an empty block while building structure — replace it with real code when ready.

```python
# pass keeps an empty if block valid while you build the program
number = 10  # A positive number
if number > 0:  # Condition for positive numbers
    pass  # Placeholder — replace with real logic later
```

## Logical Thinking — Breaking Problems Into Steps

- **Official Definition:** **Algorithmic thinking** is defining clear, ordered steps to solve a problem, where each step can be tested independently.
- **In Simple Words:** Think of the exact steps first, then write code.
- **Real-Life Example:** Making chai — boil water, add tea, add milk, add sugar. Order matters, just like in code.

### The STEP Method

1. **S — State** the problem in plain English.
2. **T — Identify inputs** the program needs.
3. **E — List conditions and outcomes** for each case.
4. **P — Write Python code** following step 3.

![STEP method — State, inputs, conditions/outcomes, and Python code with full cinema ticket example and complete working program](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitp-sdai-2606/module1/session02/session02-08-step-method.png?v=20260614)

**Example:** Cinema charges ₹150 for adults, ₹80 for children (age 12 or below).

```python
# STEP: input = age; if age <= 12 → ₹80, else → ₹150
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Input: age
if age <= 12:  # Child ticket
    print(f"Child ticket: ₹80")  # Price for age 12 and below
else:  # Adult ticket
    print(f"Adult ticket: ₹150")  # Price for age 13 and above
```

**How the code works:**

- Each condition from step E maps directly to an `if` or `else` block.
- Apply STEP before every conditional program — good logic beats memorising syntax.

### Quick Activity: Shop Discount

A shop gives 10% off when the bill is above ₹500. Write the STEP breakdown first, then code it.

```python
# Apply 10% discount if bill exceeds ₹500
bill = float(input("Enter bill amount in rupees: "))  # Total purchase amount
if bill > 500:  # Qualifies for discount
    discount = bill * 0.10  # 10% off
    final_bill = bill - discount  # Amount after discount
    print(f"Discount applied! You pay ₹{final_bill}")  # Discounted total
else:  # No discount
    print(f"No discount. You pay ₹{bill}")  # Full amount
```

**How the code works:**

- `bill` is available in both branches — do not use a variable created only inside the `if` block in the `else` block.

---

## Practice Programs — Beginner Conditional Exercises

Work through each program in OneCompiler. Type the code yourself and test with different inputs.

### Exercise 1: Positive, Negative, or Zero

```python
# Classify a number as positive, negative, or zero
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Any whole number
if number > 0:  # Greater than zero
    print(f"{number} is positive.")  # Positive
elif number < 0:  # Less than zero
    print(f"{number} is negative.")  # Negative
else:  # Exactly zero
    print(f"{number} is zero.")  # Zero
```

**How the code works:**

- Three branches cover every integer. `elif` runs only when the first condition was `False`.

### Exercise 2: Simple ATM Withdrawal

```python
# Withdraw money with balance and input validation
balance = 5000  # Current balance in rupees
withdraw_amount = int(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))  # Amount to withdraw
if withdraw_amount > balance:  # Not enough money
    print("Insufficient balance. Transaction failed.")  # Reject
elif withdraw_amount <= 0:  # Invalid amount
    print("Invalid amount. Please enter a positive number.")  # Reject
else:  # Valid withdrawal
    balance = balance - withdraw_amount  # Deduct amount
    print(f"Withdrawal successful! Remaining balance: ₹{balance}")  # Show new balance
```

**How the code works:**

- Check failure cases first (insufficient balance, invalid amount), then process valid withdrawals.

### Exercise 3: Leap Year Checker

A year is a leap year if divisible by 4, except century years (divisible by 100) unless also divisible by 400.

```python
# Check leap year using divisibility rules in order
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))  # Year to check
if (year % 400 == 0):  # Divisible by 400 — always leap (e.g., 2000)
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
elif (year % 100 == 0):  # Divisible by 100 but not 400 — not leap (e.g., 1900)
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
elif (year % 4 == 0):  # Divisible by 4 — leap (e.g., 2024)
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:  # Not divisible by 4
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

**How the code works:**

- Order matters: check `% 400` first, then `% 100`, then `% 4` — most specific rule first.

### Exercise 4: Complete Student Result Program

```python
# Collect student data
student_name = input("Enter student name: ")               # Name
maths = int(input("Enter Maths marks: "))                  # Maths marks
science = int(input("Enter Science marks: "))              # Science marks
english = int(input("Enter English marks: "))              # English marks
attendance = int(input("Enter attendance percentage: "))  # Attendance %

# Calculate totals
total = maths + science + english  # Sum of all subjects
average = total / 3                # Average marks
passed_all = (maths >= 40) and (science >= 40) and (english >= 40)  # All subjects passed?

# Display summary
print("----- Result -----")  # Heading
print(f"Name: {student_name}")  # Name
print(f"Total: {total}")        # Total marks
print(f"Average: {average:.1f}")  # Average rounded to 1 decimal

# Overall result with nested division assignment
if passed_all and (attendance >= 75):  # Pass requires all subjects + 75% attendance
    print("Result: PASS")  # Student passed
    if average >= 75:  # First division
        print("Division: First")
    elif average >= 60:  # Second division
        print("Division: Second")
    else:  # Third division
        print("Division: Third")
else:  # Failed
    print("Result: FAIL")  # Did not meet requirements
    if not passed_all:
        print("Reason: Failed in one or more subjects.")  # Subject failure
    if attendance < 75:
        print("Reason: Attendance below 75%.")  # Attendance failure
```

**How the code works:**

- Combines `input()`, arithmetic, comparison, logical operators, `elif`, and nested `if`.
- The `else` block explains **why** the student failed.

---

## Debugging Conditional Programs

- **Print the condition:** Add `print(marks >= 40)` before the `if` to see `True` or `False`.
- **Check data types:** Use `print(type(variable))` — compare numbers with numbers, not strings.
- **Trace sample inputs:** Test boundary values like 39, 40, and 90 for pass/grade programs.
- **Read indentation:** Wrong block running usually means indentation is off.
- **Check `elif` order:** Same grade for everyone means conditions are in the wrong order.

```python
# Debug tip: print the condition result before the if block
marks = int(input("Enter marks: "))  # Get marks
print("Condition result:", marks >= 40)  # Remove this line after debugging
if marks >= 40:  # Check passing marks
    print("PASS")  # Passed
else:  # Marks below passing threshold
    print("FAIL")  # Failed
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) let your program choose different actions based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.
- **Comparison operators** (`==`, `>`, `<`, etc.) and **logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`) build the conditions inside `if` statements.
- **Indentation** defines code blocks in Python — always indent `if`, `elif`, and `else` bodies with 4 spaces.
- The **STEP method** helps you think clearly before typing — good logic beats memorising syntax.
- These skills prepare you for **loops**, where you will repeat actions and combine repetition with conditions.
