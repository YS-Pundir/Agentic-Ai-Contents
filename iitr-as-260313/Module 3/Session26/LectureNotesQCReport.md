# QC Report — Session 26: Introduction to LangChain: Concepts Architecture and First Demo

## QC Pass 1

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | 5 / 5 |
| **Creativity** | 5 / 5 |
| **Structural Adherence** | 5 / 5 |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | True |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | True |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | True |
| **No Metadata / Internal References in Student Notes** | True |

**Notes:** All ten metadata subtopics covered: (1) LangChain definition, purpose, and agentic problem class in "What Is LangChain?" and context; (2) framework vs ad hoc API — composability and maintainability in dedicated section with comparison table; (3) stack placement — three-storey building and orchestration diagram; (4) Runnable mental model and chain composition; (5) modular surface mapped to single-agent workflow table; (6) Core vs Community with package table and student activity; (7) PromptTemplate and ChatPromptTemplate with hard-coded vs templated comparison; (8) LCEL and pipe operator with diagram; (9) StrOutputParser and predictable string output; (10) instructor demo walkthrough via `raw_ollama.py` → `template_only.py` → `first_chain.py` progression. Adapted from Session35 (iitr-as-260113) for iitr-as-260313 cohort: Ollama context from previous session, **ChatOllama** + **langchain-ollama** instead of OpenAI, model tag `qwen2.5:0.5b` aligned with Session25. Indian analogies: hostel FAQ, Delhi Metro, Saravana Bhavan, IRCTC, Swiggy. Five student activities in professional `[ Student Activity ]` blocks. Full code with per-line comments and "How the code works" sections. Key Takeaways and terminology table present. No session numbers, no duration, no internal instruction leakage.

**Pass 1 outcome:** PASS

## QC Pass 2 (Re-verification)

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | 5 / 5 |
| **Creativity** | 5 / 5 |
| **Structural Adherence** | 5 / 5 |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | True |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | True |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | True |
| **No Metadata / Internal References in Student Notes** | True |

**Notes:** Re-verified subtopic alignment against metadata.md line-by-line. Confirmed connecting sentences between sections (raw API pain → LangChain definition → framework justification → stack → Runnables → modules → Core/Community → prompts → LCEL → parsers → setup → three-step code progression → comparison → takeaways). Paragraphs follow 3-sentence rule; headings are direct (no Part/Section labels). Code paths consistent: Ollama must be running, model tag matches Session25, LCEL dict keys match template placeholders. References use "previous" and "upcoming" without session numbers. Groq/Ollama references accurate for cohort arc. Reused nine session35 diagram images with correct S3 URLs. Scope trimmed appropriately for 1h50m conceptual+demo session vs full 2h15m Session35 — parallel/composite chain patterns omitted in favour of single-agent workflow focus.

**Pass 2 outcome:** PASS — expected QC result achieved.

## QC Pass 3 (Image alignment fix)

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | 5 / 5 |
| **Creativity** | 5 / 5 |
| **Structural Adherence** | 5 / 5 |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | True |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | True |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | True |
| **No Metadata / Internal References in Student Notes** | True |

**Notes:** Fixed image mismatches identified in review. (1) Replaced `session35-08-lcel-pipeline.png` (ChatOpenAI labels) with `session36-02-lcel-chain-flow.png` (ChatOllama + localhost:11434) in LCEL section; added bridging sentence that demo uses **PromptTemplate** instead of **ChatPromptTemplate**. (2) Moved `session35-10-app1-vs-app2.png` to **Output Parsers** section with alt text describing parser behaviour (not app1/app2 filenames); added mapping to `template_only.py` vs `first_chain.py`. (3) Updated `session35-02` alt text to mention Ollama alongside cloud APIs. All nine image URLs verified HTTP 200. Remaining session35 images are provider-neutral or concept-only (agentic stack, Runnables, six components, PromptTemplate, agents/tools).

**Pass 3 outcome:** PASS — image relevance verified for Ollama cohort.

## QC Pass 4 (Released Notes Alignment Against Covered LOs)

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | 5 / 5 |
| **Creativity** | 5 / 5 |
| **Structural Adherence** | 5 / 5 |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | True |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | True |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | True |
| **No Metadata / Internal References in Student Notes** | True |

**Notes:** Created `Lecture Notes Released.md` from the existing lecture notes and aligned it with `Live Topic Coverage.md`. Removed the dedicated `ChatPromptTemplate` teaching content because it was marked not covered in the live coverage report. Retained covered and partially covered concepts: LangChain definition and purpose, framework justification, stack placement, Runnable model, chains, modular overview, Core vs Community, PromptTemplate, LCEL, output parsers, and the instructor-led PromptTemplate to LLM chain. Added extra concepts that were actually taught: LangChain vs building from scratch, N8N vs LangChain, Ollama CLI/setup troubleshooting, and the Swiggy-style support chatbot example. Mentimeter and post-lecture quiz protocol were not included.

**Pass 4 outcome:** PASS

## QC Pass 5 (Released Notes Re-verification)

| Criterion | Result |
|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | 5 / 5 |
| **Creativity** | 5 / 5 |
| **Structural Adherence** | 5 / 5 |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | True |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | True |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | True |
| **No Metadata / Internal References in Student Notes** | True |

**Notes:** Re-verified the released notes against the prompt requirements and the live coverage table. Confirmed the notes start directly with the lecture title, contain no metadata/duration/internal instructions, avoid session-number references, retain relevant images, use student-facing professional documentation style, and include full runnable code examples with line-level comments plus "How the code works" explanations. Search checks found no `ChatPromptTemplate`, Mentimeter/quiz protocol text, metadata leakage, duration text, or session-number references in `Lecture Notes Released.md`.

**Pass 5 outcome:** PASS — expected QC result achieved for released notes.
