## Coverage Checklist (metadata subtopics)

| Subtopic | Covered in notes |
|---|---|
| Theory only; e-commerce customer support running example (returns, shipping, warranty, refund) | Yes — ShopKart policy table and four side-by-side comparisons |
| Recognize when LLM knowledge is insufficient | Yes — static/missing/hallucination gaps, confidence vs correctness |
| Explain RAG as a grounding strategy | Yes — definitions, mermaid flow, conceptual pipeline sketch |
| Contrast ungrounded and grounded response quality | Yes — four policy question comparison tables + trust checklist |
| Relate RAG retrieve step to vector search | Yes — mapping table, same-model rule, retrieval failure modes |
| Connect to previous (vector search / Chroma) and next (implementation) | Yes — context and bridge sections without session numbers |

## Structural Adherence Checklist

| Prompt rule | Result |
|---|---|
| Starts with `# Lecture Title` only | Pass |
| No target audience / duration / internal instructions in body | Pass |
| Context paragraph + bullet list of learning goals | Pass |
| 3-sentence rule on paragraphs | Pass |
| Official / In Simple Words / Real-Life Example on new concepts | Pass |
| Integrated learning (no separate "Mistakes" section) | Pass |
| Theory session: conceptual code sketch + line comments + "How the sketch works" | Pass |
| Solo student activities (not "Ask students to…") | Pass — six Simple Activity blocks |
| Previous / next references without session numbers | Pass (fixed "Session 18" → "previous" in iteration 1 review) |
| Key Takeaways (3–5 bullets + future link) | Pass |
| Quick Reference table at end | Pass |

## Creativity Notes

- **ShopKart** running scenario with consistent policy numbers across all comparisons
- Indian-context analogies: Kirana intent, railway timetable, CA filing, Justdial listings, WhatsApp stock tips, open-book exam
- Side-by-side tables make ungrounded vs grounded quality visible without extra tooling
- Mermaid flow + paper-based activities for a no-code session

---

## Logic Review

- RAG flow (query → retrieve → context → generate) matches standard architecture and course prereads
- Retrieve step correctly equated to embedding top-k search, not conflated with full RAG
- Honest limits stated (RAG reduces but does not eliminate hallucination; search alone ≠ RAG)
- ShopKart policy examples internally consistent across return/shipping/warranty/refund tables

---

## Presentation Review

- No session numbers in student-facing references
- No "Part 1 / Section A" style headings
- Bold terms and scannable bullets throughout
- Connecting sentences between major sections present
