# Lecture Notes QC Report — Working with APIs and JSON

**File reviewed:** `Lecture Notes.md`  
**Review date:** 2026-06-20  
**Iteration:** 1

---

## QC Criteria

| Criterion | Rating / Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | **5 / 5** | All four metadata subtopics covered: (1) REST + HTTP methods + status codes with tables, activities, and images; (2) `json.loads()` / `json.dumps()` full `json_basics.py` with round-trip; (3) `requests.get()` with status-first pattern, `safe_get_demo.py`, error table, and `get_with_retry` snippet for 429; (4) `map_weather_to_variables` + `build_event_prompt` in full `campus_weather_agent_lab.py` chaining API → variables → downstream LLM prompt. Bridges from prior LLM internals (tokens, context, rate limits) without repeating full prior lessons. |
| **Creativity** | **5 / 5** | IRCTC live seats; restaurant waiter; library shelf CRUD; courier delivery vs wrong pin; campus Tech Fest outdoor stage; news anchor weather summary; hostel reimbursement scenarios; WhatsApp postal analogy. |
| **Structural Adherence** | **5 / 5** | `#` title only; context paragraph + bullet LOs; Official/Simple/Real-life on new terms; full Python with per-line comments + "How the code works"; eight student-facing Practice activities; Key Takeaways; Quick Reference table; six reused session23 images. |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | **True** | GET is read-only; status checked before `response.json()`; 429 is rate limit not syntax error; `json.loads` vs `response.json()` distinction correct; field mapping saves tokens; city label must match coordinates; weather codes mapped to words before prompting; generation vs API failure evaluation note correct. |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | **True** | No duration/audience metadata; paragraphs ≤3 sentences; professional documentation tone; activities written as "Practice" / "Your notes" (not instructor-facing). |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | **True** | Uses **previous session** only; no `Session N` or `S25` in student-facing text. Image URLs contain path segments only — not cited in prose. |
| **No Metadata/internal reference** | **True** | No "requests library lite," session duration, or internal instruction leakage. |

---

## Expected Result

- Content Coverage, Creativity, Structural Adherence: all **≥ 5** — **Met**
- No Logical Mistakes, No Presentation Mistakes, No Previous Session Number References, No Metadata/internal reference: **True** — **Met**

**Outcome:** QC passed on iteration 1.

---

## Alignment Checklist (metadata subtopics → notes sections)

| Metadata subtopic | Section in notes |
|---|---|
| Client apps communicate with REST APIs via HTTP methods and status codes | REST Conventions and HTTP Methods; HTTP Status Codes; Request–Response Pattern |
| Read and write JSON structures for requests and responses in Python | JSON — The Data Format; Reading and Writing JSON in Python (`json_basics.py`) |
| Execute GET with requests; handle common response errors safely | Executing GET Requests (`safe_get_demo.py`, error table, `get_with_retry`) |
| Map JSON fields into variables for downstream LLM prompt | Mapping API JSON Fields; Full Lab (`campus_weather_agent_lab.py`) |

**Approximate line count:** ~665 lines.

# Lecture Notes QC Report — Working with APIs and JSON (Trimmed)

**File reviewed:** `Lecture Notes.md`  
**Review date:** 2026-06-20  
**Iteration:** 3 (line-count trim to 450–500)

---

## QC Criteria

| Criterion | Rating / Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | **5 / 5** | All four metadata subtopics retained after trim: REST/HTTP/status; json.loads/dumps; requests GET with safe handling rules; full lab with field mapping → LLM prompt. Removed duplicate `safe_get_demo.py` and retry snippet — rules preserved in prose + lab. |
| **Creativity** | **5 / 5** | IRCTC, waiter, news anchor, campus Tech Fest analogies retained. |
| **Structural Adherence** | **5 / 5** | Prompt4 structure intact; full lab + json_basics with per-line comments; Key Takeaways + Quick Reference. |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | **True** | Verified after condensation. |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | **True** | No duration/metadata leakage. |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | **True** | Confirmed. |
| **No Metadata/internal reference** | **True** | Confirmed. |

**Outcome:** QC passed on iteration 3. Notes trimmed to target length.

**Approximate line count:** ~450 lines.

# Lecture Notes QC Report — Working with APIs and JSON (Released Alignment)

**File reviewed:** `Lecture Notes Released.md`  
**Review date:** 2026-06-25  
**Iteration:** 4 (post-session alignment against transcript + Live Topic Coverage)

---

## Alignment Changes Applied

| Change type | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Removed** | `response.ok`; 429 exponential-backoff retry loop; `try`/`except` timeout retry; full PATCH/PUT/DELETE CRUD table (POST brief only) |
| **Added** | Gemini LLM + external APIs section; `json.load()` file demo; free vs API-key services table; Groq Step 5 in full lab; More API-to-Prompt patterns (Fake Store, Frankfurter, GitHub); Groq rate-limit limits; LLM JSON wire-format note |
| **Updated** | Lab title and flow now includes two-call pattern (weather GET → Groq); grounding vs endpoint-error distinction; safe GET rules match status-first teaching |

---

## QC Criteria

| Criterion | Rating / Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Content Coverage** | **5 / 5** | All four metadata subtopics aligned to taught content; extras from Live Topic Coverage integrated (Gemini+APIs, free APIs, additional demos, Groq pipeline, rate limits). Removed untaught retry/`response.ok` patterns. |
| **Creativity** | **5 / 5** | IRCTC, waiter, news anchor, Gemini photos/search/Gmail, campus Tech Fest, e-commerce and forex use cases retained or added. |
| **Structural Adherence** | **5 / 5** | Prompt4 structure: context + LO bullets; Official/Simple/Real-life; full Python with per-line comments + "How the code works"; Practice activities; Key Takeaways; Quick Reference; all five session images retained. |
| **No Logical Mistakes** | **True** | GET read-only; status before `response.json()`; two-call agent pattern matches class demo; city/coords matching rule; weather code → words before prompt. |
| **No Presentation Mistakes** | **True** | No duration/audience metadata; professional student-facing tone; no poll/Mentimeter content. |
| **No Previous Session Number References** | **True** | Uses **previous session** only. |
| **No Metadata/internal reference** | **True** | No internal instruction leakage. |

---

## Expected Result

- Content Coverage, Creativity, Structural Adherence: all **≥ 5** — **Met**
- No Logical Mistakes, No Presentation Mistakes, No Previous Session Number References, No Metadata/internal reference: **True** — **Met**

**Outcome:** QC passed on iteration 4. `Lecture Notes Released.md` ready for student release.

**Approximate line count:** ~520 lines.

# Lecture Notes QC Report — Working with APIs and JSON (Released — Reference Restore)

**File reviewed:** `Lecture Notes Released.md`  
**Review date:** 2026-06-25  
**Iteration:** 5 (instructor request — keep helpful reference material)

---

## Changes

Restored student-facing reference content not live-demonstrated in class:

- **`response.ok`** in status habit + Quick Reference
- **429 exponential-backoff retry** and **`try`/`except`** timeout guidance in Safe GET Rules
- **Full PATCH / PUT / DELETE CRUD table** alongside GET lab focus

**Outcome:** QC unchanged — all criteria still met. Reference additions do not contradict taught material.
