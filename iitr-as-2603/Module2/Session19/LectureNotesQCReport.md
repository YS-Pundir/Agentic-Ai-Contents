# QC Report — Session19: Classification Models and Evaluation Metrics

## Iteration 1

| Criteria | Rating / Result |
|---|---|
| Content Coverage | 5 / 5 |
| Creativity | 5 / 5 |
| Structural Adherence | 5 / 5 |
| No Logical Mistakes | True |
| No Presentation Mistakes | True |
| No Previous Session Number References | True |

### Notes

**Content Coverage (5/5):**
All metadata topics covered: Decision Trees (rules, nodes, Gini, max_depth, overfitting); Random Forest (ensemble, bagging, voting, trade-off); Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, trade-off, three-model comparison); F1 (definition + use case, computed in shared metrics code); ROC-AUC (concept, AUC table, code + plot); Threshold tuning (concept, precision_recall_curve, best F1 vs 0.5). Context bridges from previous session (Logistic Regression, confusion matrix, accuracy limits) without session numbers. Key Takeaways and terminology table present.

**Creativity (5/5):**
Student-facing quick activities: decision-path trace, metric-choice scenario table, threshold 0.5 vs 0.6 drill. Indian-relatable examples (bank loan, cricket experts, fraud/spam scenarios). Lighter than iitr-as-2601 Session31 (~350 vs ~613 lines); F1 / ROC-AUC / threshold sections intentionally concise per batch direction (~1hr 50min).

**Structural Adherence (5/5):**
- Starts with `# Classification Models and Evaluation Metrics` — no metadata header.
- Context + bullet goals; no Part/Section labels.
- Official / In Simple Words / Real-Life Example on major new terms.
- Complete code workflows (trees + metrics + ROC + threshold) with “How the code works” lists.
- Key Takeaways and quick reference table at end.
- No student-facing session numbers (S3 paths `session31/` are asset URLs only).

**No Logical Mistakes (True):**
- Gini / max_depth / overfitting statements consistent.
- Precision = TP/(TP+FP), Recall = TP/(TP+FN), F1 harmonic mean stated correctly.
- Threshold lowering → higher recall / lower precision trade-off correct.
- `cm.ravel()` order [TN, FP, FN, TP] and `roc_auc_score` on probabilities correct.
- Train–test discipline maintained; threshold tuning noted as business-driven, not only test-set F1.

**No Presentation Mistakes (True):**
- Consistent heading hierarchy and tables.
- No “lite/light version” meta language in student notes.
- Paragraphs kept short; scannable bullets.

**No Previous Session Number References (True):**
- Prose uses “previous session” only; no “Session 18/30/31” in student text.

**Expected result:** All criteria met — no further iteration required.

## Iteration 2 — 2026-06-01 (post threshold-tuning removal + full QC per LectureNotesQC.md)

**Scope:** Re-QC after editorial update (Threshold Tuning section removed; internal “Light Touch” language removed).

### First pass (before code-comment fix)

| Criteria | Rating / Result |
|---|---|
| Content Coverage | 5 / 5 |
| Creativity | 5 / 5 |
| Structural Adherence | 4 / 5 |
| No Logical Mistakes | True |
| No Presentation Mistakes | False |
| No Previous Session Number References | True |
| No Metadata/internal reference in student-facing text | True |

**Issues found:**
- **Structural / Presentation:** Python blocks did not have simple English comments on every line (LectureNotesPrompt4 rule 5).
- **Content note:** `metadata.md` still lists Threshold Tuning; notes intentionally omit it per delivered session scope (goals list F1 + ROC-AUC only). All other metadata topics covered.

**Action taken:** Added line-by-line comments to all three code blocks in `Lecture Notes.md`.

### Second pass (after code-comment fix)

| Criteria | Rating / Result |
|---|---|
| Content Coverage | 5 / 5 |
| Creativity | 5 / 5 |
| Structural Adherence | 5 / 5 |
| No Logical Mistakes | True |
| No Presentation Mistakes | True |
| No Previous Session Number References | True |
| No Metadata/internal reference in student-facing text | True |

**Content Coverage (5/5):** Decision Trees (structure, Gini, max_depth, overfitting, activity); Random Forest (ensemble, bagging, vote, trade-off); Evaluation (precision, recall, trade-off, three-model comparison, classification report); F1 (definition trio + use); ROC-AUC (concept, AUC table, code + plot). Context from previous session without session numbers. Key Takeaways + terminology table present.

**Creativity (5/5):** Trace-a-path tree activity; metric-choice scenario table; relatable examples (bank loan, cricket experts, spam/cancer). Student-facing activities (no “Ask students to…”).

**Structural Adherence (5/5):** Clean `#` title; context + bullet goals; Official / In Simple Words / Real-Life on major terms; full code workflows with per-line comments and “How the code works”; Key Takeaways; reference table; no Part/Section labels; no duration/audience metadata in notes.

**No Logical Mistakes (True):** Metrics formulas, `cm.ravel()` order, threshold trade-off wording, `roc_auc_score` on probabilities, train-only fitting — all consistent.

**No Presentation Mistakes (True):** Scannable bullets/tables; short sections; no “lite/light touch” meta language; headings are direct and professional.

**No Previous Session Number References (True):** Prose uses “previous session” only. Image URLs contain `session31` as S3 path segments only (not cited as “Session 31” in student text).

**No Metadata/internal reference (True):** No “Light Touch,” “keep it lite,” duration, or target-audience callouts in headings or body.

**Expected result:** All criteria met — no further iteration required.
