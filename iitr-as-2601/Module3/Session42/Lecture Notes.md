# Memory & Control Flow

## Context of This Session

In the **previous** session you built a **grounded Q&A helper** on a **Tesla annual report** — LangChain **retriever** on `./Tesla_db`, **`#context`** / **`#question`** prompt assembly, **Groq** generation at **`temperature=0`**, and a **Gradio** chat UI. Each question was handled **on its own** — no memory of earlier turns.

That Gradio demo answered each question in isolation. Real analyst chat is rarely one message. You ask *"What is the annual revenue in the year 2022?"* and get a grounded figure from the report. Ten seconds later you type only *"And in 2023?"* — no year repeated, no *"revenue"* repeated. Without **memory**, the bot treats it as a brand-new question and may search the wrong passages or ask you to repeat yourself.

Two other failures show up often: the **loop runs forever** (no stop rule), or the bot shows a **scary error log** when an API fails. Today you fix all three — **remember the chat**, **stop safely**, and **fail gracefully**.

**What you will learn:**

- **Distinguish** **short-term memory** from **long-term memory**
- **Persist and reload** conversation history across turns in a notebook
- **Implement loop termination** so a chat loop cannot run forever
- **Handle predictable errors** with clear, user-visible messages

## Short-Term Memory vs Long-Term Memory

- **Official Definition:** **Short-term memory** is the **running chat history** for the **current session**. **Long-term memory** stores facts **across sessions** — saved queries, report summaries, analyst preferences.
- **In Simple Words:** Short-term is the **waiter's notepad for one table visit**. Long-term is the **loyalty card file at the counter**.
- **Real-Life Example:** On an **analyst call about the Tesla report**, everything said on that call is short-term. When you close the tab, the helper forgets unless notes are saved.

| Feature | Short-term | Long-term |
|---|---|---|
| **Duration** | This chat only | Days, weeks, months |
| **Storage** | Python `list`, JSON file | Database, user profile |
| **This session** | **Yes — main lab** | Introduced; deeper work **later** |

- **Common doubt:** *Do I need long-term memory for a three-message demo?* No — a **JSON history file** for this session is enough.
- Long-term memory matters when an analyst returns **next week** and expects the bot to remember last week's queries without repeating.

![Short-term vs long-term memory — the lab uses a JSON history file for this session; database-style storage comes in later work](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitr-as-2601/module3/session42/session42-02-short-vs-long-term-memory.png)

## Conversation History — Your Short-Term Memory

Before saving to disk, use a simple **list of messages**. Each message has a **role** and **content**.

| Role | Who spoke |
|---|---|
| **`user`** | The analyst (you) |
| **`assistant`** | The Tesla report bot |
| **`system`** | Hidden rules (optional) |

- **Order matters:** Always append **user** first, then **assistant**, for each completed turn.
- **Common mistake:** Sending only the **latest** message to the model — that erases everything from earlier turns.

```python
# Start with an empty history list
history = []

# After turn 1 — analyst asks, bot replies
history.append({"role": "user", "content": "What is the annual revenue in the year 2022?"})
history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": "Tesla's total revenue in 2022 was $96.77 billion (from retrieved report chunks)."})

# After turn 2 — follow-up without repeating the year or topic
history.append({"role": "user", "content": "And in 2023?"})
history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": "[2023 revenue figure from retrieved report chunks]."})
```

**How the code works:**

- **`history`** is a Python list — easy to grow, save, and reload.
- Each dict has **`role`** and **`content`** — the same shape most LLM APIs expect.
- Turn 2 works because **2022** and **annual revenue** are still in the list from turn 1 — so *"And in 2023?"* is understood in context.

![Conversation history as a message list — user and assistant turns appended in order; Turn 2 And in 2023? relies on Turn 1 revenue context](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitr-as-2601/module3/session42/session42-03-conversation-history-list.png)

---

## Persist and Reload Conversation History

In-memory lists vanish when you **close the notebook**. **Persist** means save to a file; **reload** means read it back on the next run.

- **Official Definition:** **Persist** writes history to durable storage. **Reload** reads that storage back into your program.
- **In Simple Words:** Save the notepad to a file; open the same file next time.
- **Real-Life Example:** A clinic desk **writes visit notes in a folder** — tomorrow's staff reads it before calling the patient.

### Save and load with JSON

```python
import json

HISTORY_FILE = "tesla_chat_history.json"


def save_history(history):
    with open(HISTORY_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(history, f, indent=2)


def load_history():
    try:
        with open(HISTORY_FILE, "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return []  # First run — start fresh
```

**How the code works:**

- **`json.dump`** writes the list to a text file you can open in any editor.
- **`json.load`** reads it back into the same list structure.
- **`FileNotFoundError`** on first run returns an empty list — safe default.

### Append and save after each turn

```python
def append_turn(history, user_text, bot_text):
    history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_text})
    history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": bot_text})
    save_history(history)  # Persist right away — survives a notebook restart
    return history
```

**How the code works:**

- **`append_turn`** keeps the **user-then-assistant** order every time.
- Saving **after each turn** means a kernel restart does not wipe the last exchange.
- **Common mistake:** Saving only at the end of the demo — one crash loses everything.

### Activity — Persist and Reload

1. Run `load_history()` on a fresh folder — you should get an **empty list**.
2. Call `append_turn` with a sample user line and bot reply.
3. Run `load_history()` again **without** re-running append — confirm both messages appear.
4. One sentence: what breaks if you skip step 3 before the next analyst question?

## Pass Memory Into Your Existing RAG Helper

Your **previous** `rag_answer(user_query, retriever)` handled one isolated question against the **Tesla index**. For multi-turn follow-ups on the same report, build the query from **history + new message** — do not rewrite retrieval or Groq setup.

- **In Simple Words:** Hand the model the **whole chat so far**, not just the newest bubble.
- **Real-Life Example:** An **analyst** re-reads earlier lines in the email thread before answering the latest reply — not just the last sentence.

```python
def build_question_with_memory(history, new_message):
    """Join prior turns into one text block the RAG helper can search with."""
    parts = []
    for msg in history:
        parts.append(f"{msg['role']}: {msg['content']}")
    parts.append(f"user: {new_message}")
    return "\n".join(parts)
```

**How the code works:**

- Loops over **`history`** so turn 2 still carries **2022 revenue** context from turn 1.
- The **new message** is added at the end — the latest analyst input.
- Pass the result to your existing **`rag_answer(full_question, retriever)`** — retrieval and generation stay unchanged.

### One-turn chat function (reuses prior lab)

```python
def chat_once(user_message, history, retriever):
    """One analyst message — search, reply, remember, save."""
    full_question = build_question_with_memory(history, user_message)

    try:
        result = rag_answer(full_question, retriever)
        bot_reply = result["answer"]
    except Exception:
        bot_reply = "Search is unavailable right now. Please try again in a minute."

    append_turn(history, user_message, bot_reply)
    return bot_reply
```

**How the code works:**

- **`rag_answer`** and **`retriever`** come from your **previous** Tesla RAG lab — no need to rebuild Chroma or Groq here.
- **`try/except`** returns a friendly line instead of a red traceback.
- **`append_turn`** updates memory and saves JSON in one step.

### Activity — Two-Turn Follow-Up

Run these two messages in order (reuse your existing **`retriever`** on `./Tesla_db` from the prior lab):

1. *"What is the annual revenue in the year 2022?"*
2. *"And in 2023?"*

Check `tesla_chat_history.json` — turn 1 must be present before turn 2 runs. One sentence: what would go wrong without that file?

## Loop Termination — Stop Rules That Protect You

Sometimes one analyst message needs **two or three internal steps** — search the report, draft reply, check if anything is missing. A **loop** handles that. Without a **stop rule**, the loop runs forever and your API bill rises.

- **Official Definition:** **Loop termination** is an explicit condition that **ends** the loop — max steps reached, task done, or user typed stop.
- **In Simple Words:** The head waiter's rule — *"After three kitchen trips for the same table, call the manager."*
- **Real-Life Example:** An ATM gives **3 PIN tries** then keeps the card — a hard stop protects the system.

### Stop rules for the lab

| Rule | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **Max steps** | `step >= MAX_STEPS` — hard ceiling on loop iterations |
| **Task done** | Model produced a final reply (no more tool/search needed) |
| **User stop** | Analyst typed `quit`, `exit`, or `stop` |

- **Max steps is non-negotiable** — even if the model wants to keep trying, your code must stop.
- **Common mistake:** Trusting the model to say *"I'm done"* with **no step limit** — it can loop on rephrased searches forever.

### Simple bounded loop

```python
MAX_STEPS = 5
STOP_WORDS = {"quit", "exit", "stop"}


def run_chat_turn(user_message, history, retriever):
    """Repeat internal steps until done or max steps — then return one reply."""

    if user_message.strip().lower() in STOP_WORDS:
        return "Chat ended. Thank you for using the Tesla report assistant."

    step = 0
    bot_reply = ""

    while step < MAX_STEPS:
        step += 1

        full_question = build_question_with_memory(history, user_message)

        try:
            result = rag_answer(full_question, retriever)
            bot_reply = result["answer"]
        except Exception:
            return "Search is unavailable right now. Please try again in a minute."

        # For this beginner lab: one RAG call = task done
        break

    if step >= MAX_STEPS and not bot_reply:
        bot_reply = "I could not finish within the safe step limit. Please try a simpler question."

    append_turn(history, user_message, bot_reply)
    return bot_reply
```

**How the code works:**

- **`MAX_STEPS = 5`** is the safety rail — raise it only after testing; never remove it.
- **`STOP_WORDS`** lets the analyst exit cleanly.
- The loop **`break`s** after one successful `rag_answer` — task done.
- If the loop ever ran all 5 steps with no reply, the user sees a **polite stop message** instead of silence.
- **`append_turn`** saves memory after the loop finishes.

- **Why a loop if we break after one step?** This session teaches the **pattern**. In **later work** the loop will run multiple search-or-reply steps before `break`.
- Duplicate-action detection and multi-step planning loops are **advanced topics** — not needed in this lab.

### Activity — Test the Step Limit

Temporarily set `MAX_STEPS = 0` and call `run_chat_turn` with any question. Confirm you get the polite step-limit message instead of an infinite loop. Set `MAX_STEPS` back to `5` before continuing.

![Loop termination — MAX_STEPS ceiling, task-done break, and STOP_WORDS prevent runaway iterations and protect API cost](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitr-as-2601/module3/session42/session42-06-loop-termination.png)

## Basic Error Handling — User-Visible Messages

When APIs fail, beginners often print **raw tracebacks**. Analysts and demo users need **plain language**.

- **Official Definition:** **User-visible error handling** catches predictable failures and returns a short, friendly message.
- **In Simple Words:** When the kitchen printer jams, say *"Small delay — I'll update you shortly"* — not the printer error code.
- **Real-Life Example:** A UPI app shows *"Bank server busy, try again"* — not a Java stack trace.

| Error type | User-visible message (example) |
|---|---|
| **Connection / API down** | *"Search is unavailable. Please try again in a minute."* |
| **Empty index** | *"Document index is empty. Please run setup first."* |
| **Blank input** | *"Please type a question."* |

- **Catch at the call site** — wrap `rag_answer` in `try/except`, not only the outer notebook cell.
- **Log for yourself, simplify for the user** — `print(error)` in the notebook is fine; the **returned string** must stay friendly.
- **Common mistake:** Returning `str(exception)` to the user — exposes messy internal text.

```python
def safe_rag_answer(question, retriever):
    """Call rag_answer; return answer or a friendly error string."""
    if not question.strip():
        return "Please type a question."

    try:
        result = rag_answer(question, retriever)
        return result["answer"]
    except Exception:
        return "Search is unavailable right now. Please try again in a minute."
```

**How the code works:**

- Checks for **blank input** before any API call.
- **`try/except`** catches network, Chroma, and generator failures in one place.
- Returns a **fixed friendly string** — same message every time, easy to trust in demos.

Swap `rag_answer(...)` inside `chat_once` or `run_chat_turn` with `safe_rag_answer(...)` if you want error handling in its own function.

![User-visible error handling — try/except returns a friendly message instead of exposing raw tracebacks to the analyst](https://s13n-curr-images-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitr-as-2601/module3/session42/session42-07-error-handling.png)

## Notebook Demo — Put It Together

This is the **one lab path** for the session. Reuse **`retriever`** and **`rag_answer`** from your **previous** Tesla RAG notebook — new cells only add **memory** and **control flow** on the same `./Tesla_db` index.

```python
# --- Already built in previous lab — run once, do not rewrite ---
# vectorstore = Chroma(persist_directory="./Tesla_db", embedding_function=embeddings)
# retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 5})
# rag_answer(user_query, retriever)  →  {"answer": ..., "retrieved_chunks": ...}

# --- Memory + control flow (new cells) ---
history = load_history()  # Reload prior turns if JSON exists

user_input = "What is the annual revenue in the year 2022?"
reply = run_chat_turn(user_input, history, retriever)
print("Bot:", reply)

user_input = "And in 2023?"  # Follow-up — year and topic not repeated
history = load_history()  # Fresh load — shows persist across cells
reply = run_chat_turn(user_input, history, retriever)
print("Bot:", reply)
```

**How the code works:**

- **`retriever`** and **`rag_answer`** are unchanged from the **previous** grounded Q&A lab.
- **`load_history`** picks up any saved chat from an earlier cell or a prior run.
- **`run_chat_turn`** adds stop rules, calls RAG with full history, appends, and saves JSON.
- Turn 2 only says *"And in 2023?"* — but history still holds the **2022 revenue** exchange from turn 1.

## When Something Goes Wrong

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Turn 2 asks to repeat the year or topic | History not saved or not loaded | Call `append_turn`; run `load_history()` before turn 2 |
| Loop never stops | No `MAX_STEPS` | Keep `MAX_STEPS = 5`; never remove the while check |
| Empty history after restart | Wrong file name or path | Confirm `tesla_chat_history.json` exists in your folder |
| Red traceback in output | Raw exception shown | Use `safe_rag_answer` or `try/except` in `chat_once` |

- Most follow-up bugs are **missing append**, not a weak model — check `len(history)` after each turn.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Short-term memory** is this session's chat list; **long-term memory** across weeks is **later work**.
- **Persist and reload** with JSON so *"And in 2023?"* still knows you were asking about **revenue** without repeating the full question.
- **Loop termination** via **`MAX_STEPS`** and **stop words** prevents runaway iterations.
- **`try/except`** with a **friendly message** builds trust when APIs fail — essential for live demos.
- Richer tool loops and long-term user memory build on this pattern in **later work** on the same track.
